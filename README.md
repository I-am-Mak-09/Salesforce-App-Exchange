AppExchange is where Salesforce customers discover amazing apps and other solutions.

### Second-Generation Managed Packaging
A second-generation managed package, or managed 2GP, is the container for the app that you plan to sell and distribute to Salesforce customers.

## AppExchange Product Lifecycle
The stages of the AppExchange product lifecycle are: Plan (1), Build (2), Distribute (3), Market (4), Sell (5), and Support (6).
