## App Type
### What Is an ISVforce App?
If you want your app to extend Sales or Service Cloud, build an ISVforce app. You can sell ISVforce apps only to existing Salesforce customers. These apps are typically designed to augment Sales Cloud or Service Cloud business functions.

### What Is an OEM Embedded App?
If your app doesnâ€™t rely on Sales Cloud or Service Cloud functionality, you want to build an OEM Embedded app.

 OEM Embedded app, you can make three types of user licenses available to your customers: 
 - Lightning Platform
 - Customer Community
 - Customer Community Plus.
